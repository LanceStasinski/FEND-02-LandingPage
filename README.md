# Landing-page
 This is a landing page designed to fullfil the requirement of the second project of Udacity's FEND Nanodegree program. The HTML and CSS were modified from the starter code provided by Udacity.

 # Description
 This landing page was built using Javascript to add a responsive navigation bar based on how many sections are in the document. The navigation bar and sections also respond when the user is viewing a section. A button that brings the user to the top of the page was also added.
